                    Sleep plays a vital role in good health
                    and well-being throughout your life. 
                    The way you feel while you are awake depends 
                    in part on what happens while you are sleeping.
                    During sleep, your body is working to support 
                    healthy brain function and maintain your physical health.
                    <br>In children and teens, sleep also helps support 
                    growth and development. Getting inadequate sleep 
                    over time can raise your risk for chronic (long-term)
                    health problems. It can also affect how well you think, 
                    react, work, learn, and get along with others.
                    Learn how sleep affects your heart and circulatory
                    system, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/metabolism">metabolism</a>, respiratory system, and immune 
                    system and how much sleep is enough.

                </header>
                <p>
                    When you fall asleep and enter non-REM sleep, 
                    your blood pressure and heart rate fall. During 
                    sleep, your parasympathetic system controls your body, 
                    and your heart does not work as hard as it does when you 
                    are awake. During REM sleep and when waking, your sympathetic 
                    system is activated, increasing your heart rate and 
                    blood pressure to the usual levels when you are awake 
                    and relaxed. A sharp increase in blood pressure and heart 
                    rate upon waking has been linked to angina, or chest pain, 
                    and heart attacks.

                <p>People who do not sleep enough or wake up often 
                    during the night may have a higher risk of:

                <p>
                    Your body makes different hormones at 
                    different times of day. This may be 
                    related to your sleep pattern or your 
                    circadian clocks. In the morning, your 
                    body releases hormones that promote alertness, 
                    such as cortisol, which helps you wake up. 
                    Other hormones have 24-hour patterns that 
                    vary throughout your life; for example, in 
                    children, the hormones that tell the glands 
                    to release testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone 
                    are made in pulses at night, and the pulses get 
                    bigger as puberty approaches.

                    The way your body handles fat varies 
                    according to various circadian clocks, 
                    including those in the liver, fat, and 
                    muscle. For example, the circadian clocks 
                    make sure that your liver is prepared to 
                    help digest fats at appropriate times. Your 
                    body may handle fat differently if you eat at 
                    unusual times.

                <p>
                    During sleep, you breathe less often and less 
                    deeply and take in less oxygen. These changes 
                    can cause problems in people who have health 
                    problems such as asthma or chronic obstructive 
                    pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma symptoms are 
                    usually worse during early morning sleep. Likewise, 
                    breathing problems in people who have lung diseases 
                    such as COPD can become worse during sleep.
                    <br> Sleep also affects different parts of your immune 
                    system, which become more active at different times of 
                    day. For example, when you sleep, a particular type of 
                    immune cell works harder. That is why people who do not 
                    sleep enough may be more likely to get colds and other 
                    infections.

                    Sleep helps with learning and the formation 
                    of long-term memories. Not getting enough sleep 
                    or enough high-quality sleep can lead to problems 
                    focusing on tasks and thinking clearly. Read our 
                    Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency page for more 
                    information on how lack of sleep affects performance 
                    of daily activities, including driving and schoolwork.
